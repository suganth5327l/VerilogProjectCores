# Verilog Project 
# Cores
Hello Folks
I'm Suganth S.
I'VE be coding some verilog for learning and since my linkedin is empty,
uploading all of those codes there.
But the projects i do now got a bit big so the old method of taking a scerrnshot and uploading 
dosent work.
Behold my not so empty github.
All my project on everythig will be here.
Even stuff i don't poston linked in.
Feel free to check it out.
Also fell free to use this projects if you find youselves needing it.




It consist of al my verilog projects.They have gotten too big to take a screenshot and put it on linkedin.So i put it on github.
